Binary Search Tree 

The BinarSearchTree class represents a binary search tree data structure.
It allows insertion, retrieval,and deletion of key and value pairs stored 
in the tree. The tree is sorted based
on the keys, with smaller keys on left and larger keys on right.
The Entry class represents a key-value pair in the binary search tree.
The Node class represents a node in binary search tree. Each node contain 
a key and value pair,and references to its left and right child nodes.
The InOrderIterator class implements the Iterator interface to
iterate over the key-value pairs in the binary search tree using 
an in-order traversal. Delete method deletes the node with the 
given key from the binary search tree.Size method returns the number
of key-value pairs stored in the binary search tree. Get method retrieves the value 
associated with the given key from the binary search tree.
